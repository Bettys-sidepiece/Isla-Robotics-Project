## RP2040-Projects
This repo is a collection of various projects done on the raspberry pico.

The first project I did on the pico was a small autonomous bot, that can avoid obstacles, later plan on including track following, self stablize, remote control (Wouldn't be autonomous anymore lol), and possibly object or colour tracking.
